The biggest goal of this game is to prototype spellcrafting by summoning runes.

Every creature has a RUNE PALLETE, which is essentially a list of RUNES the creature is currently channeling. Creatures can SUMMON different RUNES on each of their
turns. They can then CAST the RUNES on their RUNE PALLETE, once the pallete is CAST it creates a spell. The spells power is determined by whatever RUNES were on the 
pallete.

********************************************************************RUNES**********************************************************************

There are several types of runes.

AUGMENT RUNE - These runes augment the elements of the other runes on your pallete. Alone they are useless, but used in combination with combat, support, or shielding
               runes, they can greatly increase the power of the spell.

COMBAT RUNE - These runes are the most commonly cast runes. They are mostly used to cause damage, though their high element attunements can be used along with support,
              curse or shielding runes to create powerful support spells.

SUPPORT RUNE - These runes are used to modify the creature's stats. Whether it is a healing rune, or a rune that causes the creature to grow stronger.

CURSE RUNE - These runes are used to cause debilitating effects on a target. They can cause slowness, drain health, or even prevent the target from summoning runes and
             casting spells.

SHIELDING RUNE - These runes either greatly increase the targets resistance against a certain damage type, or eliminate it entirely for a short duration.

NOTE** The different types of runes will overide other types of runes. 

Shielding runes overide any other kind of rune. Once a shielding rune is in the pallete, the spell that is cast will be a shield of sorts.

Curse runes overide any rune other than shielding runes.

Support runes overide combat runes.

Combat runes are very basic in nature, therefor they do not overide any of the other types.

There can never only be augmenting runes in a spell, augment runes are always overiden.


******************************************************************ATTUNEMENT*********************************************************************

Every rune is attuned to certain bodily attributes, and can have 1 or more elements it is attuned to.

When a rune is attuned to the different attributes, those attributes determin the strength of a spell. So a rune with a high Intelligence Attunement will benefit more
from the creature's (or player's) Intelligence attribute.

Most runes are aligned to one more more elements. These elements can change the effects of the final spell once the runes are cast. If you are casting a combat spell
and it has a high Fire Attunement, the creature will cast some sort of fire spell. Remember, each creature has different resistances to different damage types, so you
may need to use different elements against different creatures. 

***Eventually certain elements can be combined to create new "Sub-Elements". Something like electricity can be created by combining Fire runes with Wind runes.
